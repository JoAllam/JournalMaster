          <h4>What are Capstone Journals?</h4>
          <p>
            Capstone Journals are a part of the capstone project at STEM
            schools. Journals are a type of prompt questions designed to monitor
            and determine the student’s growth and journey in their capstone
            project in terms of team collaboration, EDP (Engineering Design
            Process) and school subjects. We will talk about question types
            later. Capstone Journals make up 40% of Capstone Mark and so 24% of
            the total grade! You can download the latest Rubric for Capstone
            Journals

          <h4>Important details about journals</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              There are five main journals each semester. One extra makeup
              journal is made for students who missed one of the main journals
              with a proper excuse.
            </li>
            <li>
              The best 4 out of the 5 journals are used for the final grade. So
              you have one extra journal test to mess up! Nevertheless, you
              should do your best in all tests.
            </li>
            <li>
              A journal test is held on Mondays or Wednesdays during the
              capstone session, each two weeks (a week with a journal test and a
              week with no test and so on).
            </li>
            <li>
              The test’s duration is 60 minutes and is done on Google Forms. You
              must enter your school email; capstone group number and id number
              so memorize them.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are 3 journal questions in Grade 10 and 4 questions in Grade
              11 and Grade 12.
            </li>
            <li>
              The word limit for each question is 250 words. Writing 150-250
              words is recommended as writing less than 150 words might result
              in a bad grade and Google Forms won’t allow writing more. (In
              fact, Google Forms counts the characters, so in some cases, you
              might be able to write a bit more than 250 words.)

            <h4>Journal Grading</h4>
            <p>
              There are 4 grades in Journals: <span class="blue">Blue</span>,
              <span class="green">Green</span>,
              <span class="yellow">Yellow</span> and
              <span class="red">Red</span>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Each journal question gets a grade of its own from the previous
              grades. Then the journal grade is calculated using the average of
              all journal grades. so excluding the extra journal out of the 5.
              In grade 10, you have 12 journal questions and thus 12 journal
              grades to consider. In Grade 11 and 12, you have 16.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <span class="red">Red</span>, the lowest grade. Only given in the
              following scenarios:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>There’s no answer at all.</li>
              <li>The answer is irrelevant to what the question addressed.</li>
              <li>
                The answer is plagiarized by copying another student’s answer or
                using AI.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />

              <li>
                The answer is very poorly written and represented that it might
                be misunderstood.

                The answer addresses all aspects of the question and displays
                well-written context.<br />
                A green grade means the answer showed full understanding of the
                question.

            <ul>
              <li>
                The answer covers the critera of green grade. Additionally, it
                also displays creativity and specific examples.

            <strong
              >The First Question - Personal Reflection / Team
              Collaboration</strong
            ><br />
            It has two types, the question can focus on one of them, or a combination of both.
            Personal Reflection questions aim to test your
            progress and experience in your new environment and challenges in
            your STEM school to see how you adapt and face the new trials. Team
            Collaboration questions aim to evaluate your teamwork and chemistry
            with your teammates, how you address and solve problems that arise
            among your teammates and how you divide the roles and tasks among
            you to see how well you work together.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>The Second Question - EDP</strong><br />
            The second question focuses on your work in the capstone project and
            how well you are following the EDP along with the timeline and
            calendar of your project. It usually asks about the step of EDP you
            are currently in or relevant questions such as what decisions and
            steps you took and why you took them.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>The third question – Learning Transfer</strong><br />
            The third question asks about connections between your capstone
            project and learning outcomes (LOs). It might be about a simple
            idea, a mechanism, a concept or anything you have learned in your
            LOs. This question requires basic understanding of the LOs to
            answer. Usually, the connection is hard to find, or sometimes
            there’s no connection at all. So, be creative.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The fourth question in Grade 11 and Grade 12 is also learning
            transfer.

              Use Clear English
              <ul>
                <li class="special">
                  Try to write in a way that’s easy to understand. Use good
                  grammar, correct spelling and proper punctuation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It’s recommended to use advanced/academic words, but don’t
                  overdo it. You want your writing to sound smart, not
                  confusing.
                </li>
                <li class="special">
                  Avoid using simple connectors like “and” or “so” too much. Use
                  words like in addition, however, moreover, etc., to make your
                  writing flow better. Here is a

                  Make sure your sentences connect well. Don’t just throw ideas

              Structure Your Answer
              <ul>
                <li class="special">Write like an essay (It can be a paragraph or an essay, but it should be divided like an essay):-

                <ul class="essay">
                  <li>
                    Intro: Short and catchy. Mention the main idea of your answer.

                  <li>
                    Body: The main part. Explain your points in detail. One
                    point per paragraph is a good idea. For example, if the question is asking for 1 advantage and 2 disadvantages of a certain material.
                    Your body must have 3 small paragraphs, one for each point.

                  to start writing about the subject in general and forget about the question's purpose.)

              Time Management
              <ul>
                <li class="special">
                  Give each question a specific amount of time and try to finish it before that time is up. For example, in grade 10, there are only 3 question.
                  So hypothetically, each question shouldn't take more than 20 minutes. However, you should leave time for thinking, for revision and for any unexpected difficulties.
                  Therefore, 15 minutes per question is a good amount, and that leaves 15 minutes for the rest. In grade 11 & 12, 12 minutes per question (only typing) is preferable.
                  And that leaves 12 spare minutes. Practice your time management before the actual test.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Before you start writing, spend 1–3 minutes thinking.
                  Highlight the key points in the question and plan what you’ll
                  say.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The order of answering the questions is up to you. Some start
                  with the hardest, or the easiest to save time. However, I
                  advice you to start with the easiest. Most of the time, you
                  won't be able to answer the hardest question perfectly,
                  completely, or at all! So it's better to invest time in the
                  easier questions to guarantee a high grade at them.

              Be Prepared
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Read the question carefully. Don’t skip words like “give two
                  reasons” or “mention a disadvantage.” Missing details can hurt
                  your grade.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you don’t understand the question, at least write something
                  related. Don’t go completely off-topic.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Remember work and steps you have taken so far in your capstone
                  project. Memorize possible useful formulas and equations. Most
                  journal questions tend to be impossible to answer in a normal
                  realistic way. Expect the unexpected and don't be afraid to
                  use your imagination in some cases (but don't be too
                  far-fetched. Keep it real.)

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The person grading your journal is a human, not a machine.
                  Some will read everything. Some won’t.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If your introduction grabs their attention, they’ll likely
                  read the whole thing.
                </li>
                <li class="special">
                  Some evaluators just look at grammar, structure, and a few strong
                  words. Others care more about your ideas. Some care about the
                  quantity, some care more about the quality. Try to balance
                  everything.

              How to Practice
              <ul>
                <li class="special">
                  Try typing more often to get faster. You’ll need speed in the
                  real journal exam. Practice your typing speed. There are two
                  methods. First, practice typing regularly so your overall
                  speed will increase. Second, learn touch typing. (Touch typing
                  is the skill of typing using all 10 fingers and without
                  looking at the keyboard) Here are some good websites/apps to
                  practice or learn touch typing:

                </li>
                <p><strong>Spoiler Alert:</strong> Typing fast is necessary but thinking fast is equally important. 
                  Many students type fast but can't form ideas or sentences fast enough to keep up with their typing speed.
                  This cane be solved with practice and preparing ideas and memorizing them beforehand. 
                  (By ideas, I mean formulas or equations, project steps you have finished, possible question ideas not a ready journal answer or a part of it. Never do that!)
                </p>
                <li>
                  Practice using sentence starters. Learn how to paraphrase. Try
                  summarizing stuff you read.

                <li>Don’t write way too much. Stick to the word limit.</li>

          <h4>Tips & Tricks That Help</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              At the very start, write a short sentence answering the question
              directly. This shows the evaluator that you understood the
              question.
            </li>
            <li class="special">
              Examples, examples and.... examples. They are one of the key differences between a blue and a green grade.
              Give examples for everything. Make sure they are realistic and detailed.
              The more <em>useful</em> details, the better.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don’t start by listing EDP steps. Instead, say something like “We
              were working on solving X...”
            </li>
            <li>
              If the question asks for 2 advantages and 1 disadvantage, only
              write that. Don’t add more unless you have time and words to
              spare. (And it's generally better not to write more points than
              asked for)
            </li>
            <li>
              Use numbers, results, and data if you can—even if they’re made up.
              Just make sure they sound real.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can use quotes or made-up scenarios to make your intro catchy.
            </li>
            <li>
              When you explain a project or scientific idea, try to sound like
              you know what you’re doing... as you should.

            <ul>
              <li>
                A journal is not just an essay. It’s a chance to show your
                thoughts and progress in a smart and organized way.
              </li>
              <li>Be real. Be thoughtful. Be clear.</li>
              <li>
                Plan your answer, type quickly but carefully, and make sure it
                looks neat.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your job is to make the evaluator understand and believe in your
                answer. If you do that, you’re already close to getting a blue.

            <h3>The Bitter Truth</h3>
            <p>
              The world is unfair. If you follow all these tips and more, have a
              clear, direct and correct answer and do everything you can. You
              are <strong>still</strong> not 100% guaranteed to get a Blue. Even
              if it deserves one. Why? <br />
              Because capstone journals don't get evaluated in the
              <em>best way</em>. There is a rubric for each question. But
              sometimes the rubric is not clear. Or the question is impossible
              and unreasonable. Or it doesn't make sense at all. <br />Even if
              the question is clear and your answer is perfect. Sometimes, we
              don't get the most just results and grades. Each evaluator needs
              to grade hundreds of journals after each journal test. Therefore,
              some of them (not all) skim through the answers. Or gave an
              immediate green without even reading the answer. Some read the
              introduction and grade the <em>whole thing</em> based on it. Some
              look at the quantity and number of words. Some have some unique
              <strong>unreasonable</strong> standards like a very specific
              sentence they are looking for or a particular way of typing.
              <br>A journal that deserves a blue might get a green and vice versa. Nothing is certain. And you will notice
              this in the sample journals.
              <br />All of these scenarios are <strong>wrong</strong>. But they
              happen, and they happen a lot. It's better to not put high hopes
              on journal grades. You should consider journal tests as...
              <em>an errand</em>. An errand that needs to be done anyway. 80% of
              the time, most students will get a green regardless of their
              answers. Because that's the average grade and most evaluators'
              "safe" grade. 'I mean, of course your answer is not that perfect
              to get a Blue but not that bad to get a yellow.' <br />
              Despite all of this, never stop to improve and look for flaws in
              your journal answers and fix them. Despite the unfairness, some
              students, including my friends and me, managed to get 10+ blues
              per semester.<br />
              Don't lose heart, and do your best!
