            <h2>Capstone Journals</h2>
            <h4>What are Capstone Journals?</h4>
            <p>Capstone Journals are a part of the capstone project at STEM schools. 
                Journals are a type of prompt questions designed to monitor and determine the student’s growth and journey 
                in their capstone project in terms of team collaboration, EDP (Engineering Design Process) and school subjects. 
                We will talk about question types later. Capstone Journals make up 40% of Capstone Mark and so 24% of the total grade!
                You can download the latest Rubric for Capstone Journals <a href="./media/Capstone Journal Rubric.pdf" download>here</a>.

            <h4>Important details about journals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>There are five main journals each semester. One extra makeup journal is made for students who missed 
                    one of the main journals with a proper excuse.</li>
                <li>A journal test is held on Mondays or Wednesdays during the capstone session, each two weeks 
                    (a week with a journal test and a week with no test and so on).</li>
                <li>The test’s duration is 60 minutes and is done on Google Forms. 
                    You must enter your school email; capstone group number and id number so memorize them.</li>
                <li>There are 3 journal questions in Grade 10 and 4 questions in Grade 11 and Grade 12.</li>
                <li>The word limit for each question is 250 words. Writing 150-250 words is recommended as writing less 
                    than 150 words might result in a bad grade and Google Forms won’t allow writing more. 
                    (In fact, Google Forms counts the characters, so in some cases, you might be able to write a bit more 
                    than 250 words.)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Journal Grading</h4>
            <div id="grading">
                <div>
                <p> There are 4 grades in Journals: <span class="blue">Blue</span>, <span class="green">Green</span>, <span class="yellow">Yellow</span> and <span class="red">Red</span>.</p> 
                <br>
                <p><span class="red">Red</span>, the lowest grade. Only given in the following scenarios:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There’s no answer at all.</li>
                    <li>The answer is irrelevant to what the question addressed.</li>
                    <li>The answer is plagiarized by copying another student’s answer or using AI.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p><span class="yellow">Yellow</span> given in the following scenarios:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The answer doesn’t address all aspects of the question.</li>
                    <li>The answer is very poorly written and represented that it might be misunderstood.</li>
                </ul>
                <br><p><span class="green">Green</span> given in the following scenarios:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The answer addresses all aspects of the question and displays well-written context.<br>
                        A green grade means the answer showed full understanding of the question.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p><span class="blue">Blue</span>, the highest grade. Only given in the following scenarios:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The answer covers the critera of green grade. Additionally, it also displays creativity and specific examples.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p><span class="green">Green</span> is the most common grade, <span class="blue">blue</span> and <span class="yellow">yellow</span> are rare and <span class="red">red</span> is very rare.</p>

            <h4>Question Types:</h4>
            <p>The First Question - Personal Reflection / Team Collaboration<br>
                It has two types; Personal Reflection questions aim to test your progress and experience in your new 
                environment and challenges in your STEM school to see how you adapt and face the new trials. 
                Team Collaboration questions aim to evaluate your teamwork and chemistry with your teammates, how you 
                address and solve problems that arise among your teammates and how you divide the roles and tasks among 
                you to see how well you work together. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The Second Question - EDP<br>
                The second question focuses on your work in the capstone project and how well you are following the EDP along 
                with the timeline and calendar of your project. It usually asks about the step of EDP you are currently in or 
                relevant questions such as what decisions and steps you took and why you took them. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The third question – Learning Transfer<br>
                The third question asks about connections between your capstone project and learning outcomes (LOs). 
                It might be about a simple idea, a mechanism, a concept or anything you have learned in your LOs. 
                This question requires basic understanding of the LOs to answer.
                Usually, the connection is hard to find, or sometimes there’s no connection at all. So, be creative.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The fourth question in Grade 11 and Grade 12 is also learning transfer.</p>
